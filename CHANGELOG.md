## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- [guide]: Add a guide about using filters and select [here](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/discussions/186).
- [names]: Add a warning message in the logs and on the frontend with the total number of devices and entities discarded due to `duplicate names`.
- [names]: Add a warning message in the logs and on the frontend with the total number of devices and entities whose name exceeds Matter’s `32-character limit`.

- [group]: Add the link on the frontend for `group` helpers (platform = group).
- [unavailable]: Add check for `not provided` entities (state = unavailable, restored = true): they are ignored.
- [config]: Check if all `splitEntities` in the config exist.
- [update]: Add queue to fast updates: a new update stops the older ones that are still executing.

### Changed

- [package]: Update dependencies.
- [package]: Bump package to `automator` v.3.0.8.
- [package]: Bump `node-ansi-logger` to v.3.2.0.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-23

### Breaking changes for Apple Home users

- [rvc]: I want to thanks skanzoa85 that discovered another bug in the rvc implementation on the Apple Home app (https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/issues/118). In addition to the other well known bugs, the rvc must be a single device, it cannot have any other device types like switch or whatever. So if your integration adds any other device types, blacklist them.

### Added

- [config]: Improved description in applyFiltersToDeviceEntities and splitEntities.
- [readme]: Improved explanation in splitEntities.
- [log]: Changed level to info when devices and entities are skipped for filters.
- [subscribe]: Removed matter.js deprecated check of context.offline in favor of context.fabric.
- [pressure]: Added psi to hPa conversion.

### Changed

- [package]: Updated dependencies.
- [package]: Updated package to automator v. 3.0.1.
- [package]: Refactored Dev Container to use Matterbridge mDNS reflector.

### Fixed

- [mireds]: Fixed the call service turn_on with color_temp_kelvin when the light is off (Adaptive Lighting). Thanks serlinGi and CadillacCab for https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/issues/146.
- [mireds]: Fixed the call service set_temperature when the thermostat is in heat_cool mode. Thanks Eric Qian and DarkSuperT for https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/issues/134.

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-05

### Breaking changes

Since the domain [event](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-events) is now supported, please check your filters and/or whiteList.

### Race condition

We have a race condition when, after a blackout or with docker compose or with other systems that start more then one process, Matterbridge starts before other required system or network components.

Race condition can cause missing configuration or missed devices on the controller side.

Added a fail safe check for Home Assistant core state RUNNING. The plugin and so the bridge will not start before the Home Assistant core is RUNNING (fully started).

The plugin will fetch all data only after the Home Assistant core is fully started.

### Added

- [platform]: Added domain [event](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-events).
- [platform]: Added rest api to check if HomeAssistant is running (startup is finished) before fetching the data. This avoid to start the plugin with incomplete data.
- [platform]: Added platform memory cleanup before throwing error for host and token missed.
- [platform]: Added snackbar message on the frontend when Home Assistant disconnect and reconnect.
- [platform]: Added restart required when Home Assistant reconnect. If the configuration changed you need to restart the plugin.
- [homeAssistant]: Added HomeAssistantLightColorMode enum, DEFAULT_MIN_KELVIN and DEFAULT_MAX_KELVIN.
- [homeAssistant]: Added HassStateEventAttributes type.
- [homeAssistant]: Added Home Assistant core state check.
- [converters]: Added hassDomainEventConverter.
- [converters]: Use HomeAssistantLightColorMode enum.

### Changed

- [package]: Updated dependencies.
- [package]: Updated to the current Matterbridge signatures.
- [package]: Requires Matterbridge v.3.4.0.
- [package]: Updated tests to use the Matterbridge Jest module.
- [package]: Bumped package to automator v.2.1.0.
- [platform]: Changed savePayload() to async.
- [converters]: Bumped `Converters` to v.1.2.0.
- [homeAssistant]: Bumped `HomeAssistant` to v.1.2.0.

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-14

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added

- [config]: Added sanity check for old configs. The user should open the config and save it each major or minor upgrade.
- [light]: Added conversion from mireds to kelvin. Home Assistant will remove mireds in 2026 but the color temperature in matter is in mireds. This may generate a not perfect conversion.

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.4.2] - 2025-09-09

### Breaking changes

Added support for **Apple Home Adaptive Lighting**. See https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge/discussions/390. Now the lights don't turn on when the controller sends a command to be executed when the light is off (In Home Assistant, changing brightness or color (all modes) without affecting the on/off state of a light is not possible.).

See also the breaking changes of the releases 0.4.0 and 0.3.0 please.

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.4.1] - 2025-09-06

### Breaking changes

See the breaking changes of the releases 0.4.0 and 0.3.0 please.

### Added

- [readme]: Improved the readme.
- [jest]: Added an helper to make all tests standard and more efficient.
- [platform]: Typed HomeAssistantPlatformConfig.

### Changed

- [package]: Updated dependencies.

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-02

### Breaking changes

**The 'remap' has been activated for the device entities too. This will cause the resulting Matter devices to be differently composed, so the controller can have issues to show the changed devices.**

Since in Matter there is no official way to change an existing endpoint (only Matter 1.4.2 introduces it),

**if the controller has issues to show the new device composition, try to power it off, wait 5 minutes, then power it again.**

On the Matterbridge log you should see after a while this line.

[22:35:38.583] [ServerSubscription] Sending update failed 3 times in a row, canceling subscription 3926576955 and let controller subscribe again.

When you see this message in the log, you can power again the controller (or maybe just wait the 5 minutes).

**If this still doesn't solve the issue, you may need to reset all the registered devices (from the frontend) or repair the bridge.**

See also the breaking changes of the release 0.3.0 please.

### Added

- [MutableDevice]: Bumped MutableDevice to v. 1.3.1.
- [MutableDevice]: Optimize memory with destroy().
- [Platform]: Optimize memory calling destroy() on MutableDevice.
- [MutableDevice]: Added automatic 'remap' ability in MutableDevice for devicee entities: this remaps the not overlapping child endpoints to the device main endpoint.
- [config]: Added splitEntities. The device entities in the list will be exposed like an independent device and removed from their device.
- [platform]: Bumped HomeAssistantPlatform to v. 1.5.0.

### Changed

- [package]: Updated dependencies.

### Fixed

- [vacuum]: Fix bug causing the plugin not to load when the vaccum is a device entitiy and has no battery and enableServerRvc is enabled (https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-hass/issues/88).

<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luligugithub"><img src="https://matterbridge.io/assets/bmc-button.svg" alt="Buy me a coffee" width="80"></a>

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-28

### Breaking changes

With this release, all supported domains are available also in the single entities. This will bring in a lot of new Matter devices. I suggest to check carefully the whiteList and the blackList and also the log for duplicated names.
